      "commentary": "As World War II raged across the Pacific the US Navy suffered a humiliating defeat at Rennell Island. American forces overconfident and unprepared were caught in a deadly storm of Japanese torpedoes sending the USS Chicago to a watery grave. With bodies sinking beneath the waves and the war machine creaking under its own weight hope seemed to slip away as the Imperial Japanese Navy celebrated another savage victory."
